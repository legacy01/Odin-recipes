            holes in the stew and each egg yolk in each hole. Cover and simmer for a minute or two, do not stir. Beat
            the egg whites together, make another set of individual holes, and pour bits into each hole. DO NOT STIR.

        <li>Alternatively, beat eggs together. Make holes in the stew and pour bits into each hole. Do not stir, cover
            and simmer till eggs are set. This is to ensure that the eggs forms big clumps. Serve with any dish of
            choice.</li>
